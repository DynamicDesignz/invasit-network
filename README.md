# invasit-network
Invasit is an automatizated bash script to invade WPA2 networks with wordlist method. Maybe you are tired (as me) to open several terminals and write several lines just to put the nic in monitor mode, get the bssids' and bla bla bla. Here is a new way, easy way, that I hope to grow up and become a monster of network invasions. It's a housemade script so you can find many errors or you know some trick to let it easier, please, let me know and fix them as you well want. To a better future. Note: the working part is ok and I will add the beauty features as soon as I can, thanks!

It was made in a Kali 2.0 bash, so it works fine on it, for sure. 

How to:

\# https://github.com/valvesss/invasit-network.git

\# cd invasit-network

\# sudo bash invasit.sh
